## How does terraform work?
   Terraform has the ability to automate Infrastructure for different clouds via its registry. i.e. it has api connecting every cloud servicee built in. It also provides a tool to write your own registry.

   This is how terraform works. It creates a state
   for the infrastructure similar what github does for code.

   Github has different states of the codebase every individual is working on before being combined together. Terraform does the same.
