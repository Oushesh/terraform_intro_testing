# terraform_intro_testing

   Udemy Course for Hashicorp

## Installation:

## Steps: 
   * Get certification from hashicorp.

## Advantages: 
   1. Build and tear down infrastructure for running experiments within 30s. instead of 15-20 min of configuration.
   2. Leading to cost saving for not running the tests of infrastructure overnight.
   3. Automation of cloud infrastructure from any cloud to any cloud.
   4. Infrastructure-as-code: 
   1 command to build all of it and tear it all down.
   Infrastructure-as-code. Next step in AI would be be build the workflow.
   5. agent-less. There are providers 
   6. Multi-cloud (does not lock to one cloud). State based.
      one source of truth: like git for infrastructure.
   7. Using terraform-cloud: the changes made to the state are locked, preventing unwanted changes.
   8. No manual click-ops
   9. Massive Cost-Savings.

## Fire-rapid questions:
    What is the difference between docker and terraform?

## Personally Identifiable Information: something to look for.

## Terraform Google Example

    * Install google cloud from here: gloud https://cloud.google.com/sdk/docs/install
    This will communicate with terraform registry service.
